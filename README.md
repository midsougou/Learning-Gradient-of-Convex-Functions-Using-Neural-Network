# Learning-Gradient-of-Convex-Functions-Using-Neural-Network
This repository contains the implementation of the paper "Learning Gradients of Convex Functions with Monotone Gradient Networks". The paper introduces two new neural architectures that helps in learning gradient of convex functions. This has also an utility in optimal transport domain mainly the Brenier Map Theorem.
